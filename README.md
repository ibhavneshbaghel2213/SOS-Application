# SOS-Application

SOS-Application is a project aimed at improving the response time for ambulance services in the event of road accidents. This CCTV Camera-based system is designed to automatically detect accidents on roads and promptly send the location information to nearby hospitals, streamlining the process of dispatching ambulances to accident sites.

## Problem Statement

In today's world, one of the common causes of fatalities in road accidents is the delayed arrival of ambulance services. To address this critical issue, the SOS-Application project proposes an innovative solution to automate the process of dispatching ambulances to accident locations swiftly.

## How it Works

1. **Saving Lives**: SOS-Application plays a crucial role in saving lives by reducing the response time in the event of road accidents.

2. **Accident Detection**: The system automatically detects road accidents through CCTV cameras and captures critical information.

3. **Location Sharing**: Once an accident is detected, the system immediately sends the accident location, including latitude and longitude, to nearby hospitals.

4. **Ambulance Dispatch**: Hospitals equipped with this system will accept the request and promptly dispatch ambulances to the accident location.

## Technologies

The SOS-Application project utilizes a variety of technologies to achieve its objectives:

- **Languages**: Python, HTML5, JavaScript
- **Framework**: Django
- **APIs**: Google Places API, Vonage API, etc.
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Algorithm**: YOLOv5 model and custom deep learning models for accident detection.
